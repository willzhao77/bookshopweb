		<h1>Finding the Value of Old Books</h1>
		<P>Do you have an old or antiquarian book and would like to know its value? You might think it's a rare and valuable book but don't know where to find its value? One very simple method of finding an approximate value of a book is to search for similar copies on yeoldbookshop.com and see what prices are being asked.</p>

		<h2>Key Factors That Influence Book Values</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Condition is very important and will greatly influence value. A beaten-up old book that is falling apart will have little value.</li>
			<li>First editions are sought-after by book collectors and a first edition is usually more valuable than a later printing. A first edition signed by the author will have even greater value.</li>
			<li>Scarcity influences value.</li>
			<li> For hardcover books published from the 20th century onwards, the presence of a dust jacket and its condition also greatly affect value.</li>
			<li>If you are having difficulty understanding some of the terms used by rare booksellers, refer to our glossary, which also includes a guide to used book conditions and book sizes.</li>
